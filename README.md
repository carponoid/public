bb-pr-java is my first attempt to re-wreite https://github.com/quotidian-ennui/bitbucket-pr as Java application

JGit has been used to perform git operations, JGit dont support pull requests so relying on okHttp client to perform rest operations

copy to clipboard & complete.sh is not implemented, tried to replicate as closely I can to the original app that was written in shell script

No logs has been implemented, outputs are directly wirrten to console.

Unit tests are very much wrok in progress and the tests are autogenerated using randdop - not the best but used it for starters and develop on top of those tests. Git mocking and e2e integration tests are WIP and thinking of comparing the ouputs from the original app vs java version - this kmight take a bit.
