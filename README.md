# bitbucket - pull request using java (bb-pr-java)



bb-pr-java is my first attempt to re-write https://github.com/quotidian-ennui/bitbucket-pr as Java application

JGit has been used to perform git operations, JGit dont support pull requests so relying on okHttp client to perform PR operations via REST

copy to clipboard & complete.sh is not implemented, tried to replicate as closely I can to the original app that was written in shell script

No logs has been implemented, outputs are directly wirrten to console. Outputs are raw at the moment, jq or jf formatting not implemented yet

Unit tests are very much wrok in progress and the tests are autogenerated using randoop - not the best but used it for starters and develop on top of those tests. Git mocking and e2e integration tests are WIP and thinking of comparing the ouputs from the original app vs java version - this might take a bit.

Requires my_bitbucket_username and my_bitbucket_app_password env variables set up for the git/bb connection to work
